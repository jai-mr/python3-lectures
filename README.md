# A Short Intro of Python 3

## Introduction
Python is a modern, robust, high level programming language. It is very easy to pick up even if you are completely new to programming.

## How to learn from this resource?
You can download the pdf copy from here : [Get Started with Python](https://github.com/rajathkumarmp/Python-Lectures/blob/master/Python.pdf)

It is better to download all the ipython notebooks from this repository https://github.com/rajathkumarmp/Python-Lectures and learn it on the notebook itself rather than having to refer to a pdf.

Launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks. Open each one of them

    Cell > All Output > Clear
    
This will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each statement and learn interactively.
